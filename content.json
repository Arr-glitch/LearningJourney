        "passage": "Henrietta Dawson, a businessperson from Portsmouth, is the new Businessperson of the Year. Henrietta heard she had won the prize at a dinner in London last night.\n‘I can’t believe I won the title!’ Henrietta said when she found out. ‘There are hundreds of good, hard-working businesspeople out there, so when people tell you that you’re the best it’s just fantastic.’\nHendrietta runs three companies that make food and drink to sell to hotels and restaurants in and around her hometown. ‘I couldn’t have done it without my parents and husband. They’ve given me a lot of help,’ Henrietta said.\nHendrietta’s mother was also a successful businessperson and taught her daughter that anything is possible if you work hard. Henrietta is also lucky because her husband, Pete, put his own career on hold to look after their two young children.\nHendrietta is the first woman to win the title. Last year’s winner, Tom Lawson, who runs a successful tourism company, was at the dinner too. ‘The competition is an important way to get people interested in starting their own businesses,’ he told the audience. ‘Of course, not everyone wants to do it, but you don’t need to come from a rich family to be a successful businessperson.’\nHendrietta could one day be a rich woman. But she isn’t one yet; the money she makes goes back into her businesses, not into her pocket.",

        "passage": "Gerald\nWhen I was a boy, my parents worked in Africa for two years. We visited lots of exciting places there and I have loved travelling and exploring since then. I usually choose to travel alone because it is easier to meet people that way. I often stay with the new friends I make on my journeys, and finding out about new cultures is my favourite part of exploring.\nSimone\nMy favourite places are in the cold parts of the world. There are some areas, covered in snow and ice, where almost no one has ever been before. I usually go on foot because there are no roads. I plan my trips very carefully – I like to be well prepared and I take lots of special equipment with me. I sometimes go for days and weeks without seeing other people – I like the opportunity that gives me to think about my life and to make plans.\nFrank\nI do most of my exploring by boat. It can take me weeks to get somewhere I could drive to in a day, but it is all about the journey. I always take someone else because my boat needs two people and I don’t think I would like to go alone. There usually aren’t many people at all in the places that I explore, so I don’t often meet new people. My boat is quite small so I can get to places that other, bigger boats can’t get to. That makes travelling even more interesting.",
